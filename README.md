# BUG-BOUNTY-EXTENSION
# Bug Bounty Automation Agent - README

This repository contains the code for an automated Bug Bounty Agent designed to test for common web application vulnerabilities. The agent will be implemented as a **Chrome Extension**, leveraging **content scripts**, **background workers**, and **a crawler** to automatically identify vulnerabilities on any web page. 

The extension will be able to detect common vulnerabilities such as **SQL Injection**, **XSS**, **LFI**, **IDOR**, and many more, providing security testers with an efficient way to scan websites and gather reports.

## **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:
- **Chrome** or **Firefox** installed.
- A basic understanding of web security testing and vulnerability identification.
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine (for development).
- Target websites for testing (ensure you have permission for testing).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bug-bounty-automation-agent.git
   cd bug-bounty-automation-agent
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies** (if your extension has external packages)
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Load the Extension in Chrome**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable **Developer Mode**.
   - Click **Load unpacked** and select the `extension/` folder.
4. **Configure the Extension**
   - Adjust scan options or tweak vulnerability tests in the UI as needed.

Extension Architecture
The extension consists of the following parts:

manifest.json: Configuration file defining extension metadata and permissions.

background.js: The background script manages scanning tasks and communicates with content scripts.

content.js: The content script interacts directly with web page elements and injects test payloads.

popup.html: The popup UI allows the user to interact with the extension.

popup.js: Handles UI interactions and passes commands to background.js.

utils.js: Helper functions used across various vulnerability checks.

Vulnerability Detection Guide
Injection-Based Vulnerabilities
These vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can inject malicious code into input fields or HTTP requests to manipulate server-side operations.

1. SQL Injection (SQLi)
Description: Malicious input in query strings or form fields can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

Test: Inject SQL payloads into form fields and URL parameters. Payloads include:
```sql
' OR 1=1 --
' UNION SELECT null, null --
```
AI Workflow:

For each form and URL parameter, inject common SQL payloads.

If the server returns error messages related to SQL, flag it as vulnerable.

2. NoSQL Injection
Description: Similar to SQL injection, but targeting NoSQL databases like MongoDB.

Test: Inject NoSQL-specific payloads like:
```json
{ "$ne": "" }
```
AI Workflow:

For input fields that interact with NoSQL databases, inject NoSQL-specific payloads.

Detect error messages or unusual database behavior.

3. OS Command Injection
Description: Allows attackers to execute system commands through unsanitized user input.

Test: Inject OS command payloads such as:
```bash
; ls
| cat /etc/passwd
```
AI Workflow:

Inject OS commands into input fields or URL parameters.

Check if the server responds with system-level information.

Authentication & Session Management Flaws
4. Credential Stuffing
Description: Using leaked credentials from other sites to perform unauthorized login.

Test: Attempt login with known breached credentials.

AI Workflow:

Use a list of known compromised credentials to attempt login.

If login succeeds, flag it as vulnerable.

5. Session Fixation
Description: Forcing users to use a predetermined session ID.

Test: Set a predefined session ID and attempt login.

AI Workflow:

Check if the server allows session ID manipulation without validating the user’s session.

Authorization & Access Control Issues
6. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Description: Accessing unauthorized resources by manipulating URL parameters (e.g., /user?id=123).

Test: Modify URL parameters like id or uid to access other user data.

AI Workflow:

Modify the identifier (e.g., id=123 to id=124).

Check if unauthorized data is returned.

7. Path Traversal
Description: Accessing files outside the intended directory (e.g., /user/../../etc/passwd).

Test: Inject payloads like ../../etc/passwd into file input fields.

AI Workflow:

Test file path parameters and check if sensitive files can be accessed.

Client-Side Attacks
8. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Description: Injecting malicious JavaScript into web pages that executes in users’ browsers.

Test: Inject common XSS payloads such as:
```html
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
```
AI Workflow:

Inject XSS payloads into forms, URL parameters, and cookies.

If the payload executes, flag the page as vulnerable.

9. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Description: Forcing users to perform actions on behalf of an attacker.

Test: Submit a form with a hidden action to a vulnerable endpoint.

AI Workflow:

Identify forms that do not use anti-CSRF tokens.

Submit forged requests to test for CSRF.

Server-Side Vulnerabilities
10. XML External Entity (XXE)
Description: Exploiting XML parsers to read files or perform SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery).

Test: Submit malicious XML payloads.

AI Workflow:

Identify XML input points.

Inject XXE payloads like:
```xml
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
```
Implementation Steps
Crawling the Site
To perform a complete scan, the agent first needs to crawl the website:

```javascript
function crawlSite(url) {
  fetch(url)
    .then(response => response.text())
    .then(body => {
      let links = extractLinks(body); // Function to extract all links from the page
      links.forEach(link => crawlSite(link)); // Recursively crawl links
    });
}
```
Injecting Test Payloads
Once crawling is complete, the agent will inject test payloads into all detected form fields and URL parameters. The content.js script will handle this by finding form fields and injecting predefined malicious inputs.

```javascript
function injectXSSPayload() {
  let payloads = ["<script>alert('XSS')</script>", "<img src='x' onerror='alert(1)'>"];
  let inputs = document.querySelectorAll("input, textarea");
  inputs.forEach(input => {
    payloads.forEach(payload => {
      input.value = payload;
      input.dispatchEvent(new Event("input"));
    });
  });
}
```
Reporting Findings
The background script will collect findings and pass them to the UI for display.

```javascript
function reportVulnerability(vulnerability, severity) {
  chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
    action: "reportVulnerability",
    vulnerability: vulnerability,
    severity: severity
  });
}
```
UI/UX Design
The UI should allow users to:

Start a Scan: A button that starts the vulnerability scanning process.

View Results: A list of vulnerabilities found, categorized by severity.

Detailed View: Expandable details for each vulnerability (e.g., description, impact, mitigation).
```html
<button id="scanBtn">Start Scan</button>
<div id="results"></div>
```
Conclusion
This Bug Bounty Automation Agent uses a combination of content scripts, background workers, and crawlers to scan web pages for a wide range of vulnerabilities. The agent automates the process of discovering vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, IDOR, and more, making it easier for bug bounty hunters to identify potential security flaws.

You can contribute by adding more checks, improving the crawler’s performance, or providing new payloads for specific vulnerabilities. This tool is designed for educational purposes and should only be used on websites where you have explicit permission to perform security testing.

This README outlines everything needed for the AI agent to understand how to perform web security testing. It covers crawling, vulnerability detection, reporting, and UI interaction. If you’re ready to implement it, the next steps involve coding the extension using the instructions provided.

### **Key Concepts Covered in This README**:
1. **Vulnerability Detection**: Instructions for each type of vulnerability and how the agent should test for them.
2. **Crawling and Payload Injection**: How to crawl a site and automatically inject test payloads.
3. **Reporting**: How to report vulnerabilities to the user through the extension's UI.
4. **UI/UX Design**: Simple guidance on building the user interface to interact with the extension.

By following this comprehensive guide, the AI agent will be equipped to scan websites for a wide variety of security
